# CheckMySkin - Skin Disease Detection

## ðŸ“„ Project Description:
CheckMySkin is an AI-powered web application designed to assist general users in the early detection of common skin diseases through image analysis. By simply uploading a photo of a skin condition, users can receive an instant prediction of the possible disease along with confidence levels and basic medical information.

The platform leverages deep learning and computer vision to identify various skin conditions such as eczema, acne, psoriasis, and melanoma. The goal is to provide accessible, fast, and affordable skin health screening, especially for people who lack immediate access to dermatologists.

This tool is not a replacement for medical professionals but aims to raise awareness and encourage timely medical consultation when needed.
